Summary: Thoughts on making a website
Status: published

*Beef Jerky* was a several month long solo endeavor. It was tough, but I really did believe in this project. 
I studied art, music, narrative design - anything that might help improve this game. I put in the hours.
I put in the days. And then... finally. It was finished. 

With as fresh a perspective as I could manage, I played the game through once.

I took a step back, like a painter about to admire a job well done.

I thought to myself,

>"This is trash."

Sigh. Another game I'm not entirely proud of. Woe is I. Me is woe. I am so full of woe. Well... 
I guess my best was not quite good enough this time. Which is fine, but damn. It doesn't really feel great.

Looking back, development was a hot mess. I swapped my plan around so often, so frivolously, and so spontaneously
that it's honestly a miracle that I managed to finish. I'd prefer not to repeat this. In the days after completing
*Beef Jerky*, I wanted to... do anything but lie in bed and sleep too much. Which is what I was doing.

Somehow, I ended up making this website using Pelican. 
Having very little webdev experience, it was
rather frustrating... but rewarding nonetheless. Here, you can expect me to post devlogs for future projects, as well
as whatever else I feel like posting about. My hope is that this will become a way to organize and consolidate my 
thoughts, as well as to perhaps teach people a thing or two. :). Maybe it'll even be therapeutic?
