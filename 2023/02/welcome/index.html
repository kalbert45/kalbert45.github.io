    <p><em>Beef Jerky</em> was a several month long solo endeavor. It was tough, but I believed in it. 
I studied art, music, narrative design - anything that might help. I put in the hours.
I put in the days. And then... finally. It was finished. </p>
<p>With as fresh a perspective as I could manage, I played the game through once.</p>
<p>I took a step back, like a painter about to admire a job well done.</p>
<p>......</p>
<p>Not good. Not good at all.</p>
<p>Man. Woe is I. I am so full of woe. Am I doing something wrong, or are these growing pains? Either way, 
a bit frustrating... and I can't help but feel I can make something better.</p>
<p>I failed. But somehow it doesn't feel all that bad. Hmm......</p>
<p>...Well, in retrospect, development was definitely a hot mess. I swapped my ideas around so often and so spontaneously
that it's honestly a miracle that I managed to finish. I think I was trying a bit too hard to make something different.
In trying to force myself to come up with something cool and unique, I ended up with something half-baked and lukewarm.
The lesson: my plans require <strong>focus</strong>. </p>
<p>Lucas Pope said to center a game around one core mechanic.</p>
<p>Captain Disillusion said the key to creativity is to take something that works and add your own flair to it.</p>
<p>These are words I did not take seriously enough. Of course, I had to learn this the hard way. I'm always learning 
things the hard way. Why can't I just listen the first time? &gt;_&gt;</p>
<p>...Anyways, in order to achieve focus, I ended up making this website using Pelican. 
Having very little webdev experience, it was rather frustrating... but rewarding nonetheless. 
Here, you can expect me to post devlogs for future projects, as well as whatever else I feel like posting about. 
My hope is that this will become a way to organize and consolidate my thoughts. A way for me to look back and remember
all the lessons I'll inevitably forget. And if anyone ever finds their way here... it might even prove to be a source
of mild entertainment. :)</p>
